The migration will\nfollow a lift-and-shift strategy initially, followed by containerization.\nArchitecture\nApplications will be deployed using Docker containers orchestrated via Kubernetes.

Role-based access\ncontrol will be enforced across internal systems.\nData Protection\nSensitive data must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption standards. Regular audits will be\nconducted quarterly.\nIncident Response\nSecurity incidents must be reported within 24 hours. The incident response team will conduct a root\ncause analysis.\n", "source": "Enterprise_Security_Policy.pdf"}]
